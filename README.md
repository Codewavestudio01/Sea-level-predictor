# Sea Level Predictor (Enhanced)

This project reads a CSV of sea level data and visualizes trends using linear regression. It:

- Plots a scatter of yearly sea level changes.
- Fits a regression line over all years to 2050.
- Fits a regression line from year 2000 onward to 2050.
- Saves the resulting plot as `sea_level_plot.png`.
